Hi there!

I'm @DaveGold35, and I'm a developer who focuses on Machine Learning Applications.  I've began my journey last year as a developer 
while completeing a Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence. I wrote my disseration on the application of computer vision to monitor shelter animal behavior.

I am now learning JS, Django, and focusing on projects that will improve my overall understanding of software architecture design.
